# Welcome to SOLID workshop!

![SOLID design principles](./solid.png)

## How does it work
The main goal of this exercise is to identify SOLID principles violations, and refactor them accordingly.
There are also a few tasks to do:
1. Add new coffee type - Black coffee (100ml)
2. Add new coffee machine - espresso machine, which can only make drinks without milk: espresso and black coffee

Keep in mind, that after the refactoring exercise, completing the tasks should be smooth and simple.
